future features:

sometimes, choose a follower; compliment them by name on the public timeline
  instead.

allow someone to request a compliment for someone else (respecting #nobot,
  of course)

the 11-year-old requests emoji support

add a plural-noun style of compliment, so we can say things like "your
  principles are super"

read words from files so we can reload the vocabulary without restarting
    the bot
